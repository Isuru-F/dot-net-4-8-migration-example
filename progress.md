- [x] **API Contract Documentation** - All endpoints catalogued  
- [x] **Dependency Analysis** - NuGet compatibility matrix created
- [x] **CI/CD Pipeline Analysis** - GitHub workflow migration plan ready
- [x] **Risk Assessment** - Comprehensive risk matrix documented
- [x] **Migration Plan Creation** - 3-phase strategy defined and optimized
- [x] **Plan Simplification** - Removed K8s complexity, added frequent build/test strategy

### üìã Validation Criteria Established
- API contract identical validation tests
- Unit test coverage maintenance (100%)
- Build and test after every change
- Zero client application impact
- Commit at end of each phase

### üîÑ Build and Test Strategy
- **Build immediately** after each project migration
- **Run tests** after each successful build
- **Document blockers** in progress.md immediately
- **Only proceed** if build and tests pass
- **Commit** at end of each phase with updated progress

- [x] Commit Phase 1 with descriptive message

### üîç Phase 1 Validation Criteria

#### Build Validation
- [ ] All core libraries compile without warnings
- [ ] New ASP.NET Core project builds successfully
- [ ] NuGet packages restore without conflicts
- [ ] Docker image builds successfully

#### Test Validation  
- [ ] All existing unit tests pass in .NET 8
- [ ] New health check endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Basic dependency injection works
- [ ] Configuration loading works

#### Pipeline Validation
- [ ] CI/CD builds complete successfully
- [ ] Code quality gates pass
- [ ] Docker images publish correctly
- [ ] Test coverage reports generate

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 1 Blockers & Risks
- **Package Incompatibilities**: Monitor for breaking changes in updated packages
- **Configuration Issues**: App.config to appsettings.json mapping
- **Build Environment**: Ensure .NET 8 SDK availability in CI/CD

### üìà Phase 1 Success Metrics
- **Build Success Rate**: 100% clean builds
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% existing tests passing
- **Pipeline Success**: CI/CD completing within 10 minutes
- **Code Coverage**: Maintain existing coverage levels

## Phase 2: API Migration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### üéØ Phase 2 Objectives
1. Create new ASP.NET Core 8 API project
2. Migrate controllers to ASP.NET Core with identical routing
3. Implement configuration system migration (App.config ‚Üí appsettings.json)
4. Set up dependency injection (Autofac ‚Üí built-in DI)
5. Preserve exact JSON serialization behavior with Newtonsoft.Json
6. Build and test after each controller migration
7. Commit completed API migration

### üìã Key Phase 2 Tasks (Detailed planning in phase-2.md)
- ASP.NET Core project creation with immediate build/test
- Health controller migration (simplest first)
- Tax calculation controller migration (core business logic)
- Configuration system migration with validation
- Manual API testing after each controller
- Integration testing setup

## Phase 3: Validation & Documentation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### üéØ Phase 3 Objectives
1. Comprehensive contract validation testing
2. API compatibility verification between old and new
3. Update CI/CD pipeline for .NET 8
4. Create migration documentation
5. Knowledge transfer and handover documentation
6. Final validation and sign-off

## Current Session Notes

### üìù Session: Migration Planning & Documentation
**Date**: Current  
**Focus**: Comprehensive migration analysis, planning, and documentation

#### Completed This Session:
- Oracle analysis of entire solution architecture
- Sub-agent analysis of dependencies and CI/CD
- Created migration overview and risk assessment
- Established 3-phase migration strategy (simplified from original 4-phase)
- Set up progress tracking system with frequent build/test approach
- Updated migration plan to focus on core framework migration (removed K8s complexity)
- Added build-and-test-frequently strategy for continuous validation
- Configured git commit strategy for each phase completion
- Created detailed phase documentation for all 3 phases
- Established blocker management and escalation procedures

#### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Preserve Newtonsoft.Json**: Avoid System.Text.Json to maintain exact compatibility
2. **3-Phase Approach**: Simplified from 4 phases, removed Kubernetes deployment
3. **Build and Test Frequently**: Build and test after every project migration
4. **Commit at Phase Completion**: Update progress then commit with detailed message
5. **Document Blockers Immediately**: Track issues in progress.md as they occur

#### Ready for Next Session:
- Phase 1 execution can begin immediately
- All analysis documents created and updated
- Task checklists prepared with build/test steps
- Commit strategy established
